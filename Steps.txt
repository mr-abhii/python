got that done.thank god

connecting gitbash to github

git config --global user.name "(username)"
git config --global user.email "(email)"






created a folder in c with name git
in gitbash changed directory to C[ cd /c] and then to git folder

in github.com created a repository-> and copied its url

in gitbash-cloned the repository in git folder
git clone (url), parenthesis not needed

cd into the cloned repository and created this text file(not in gitbash, just right clicked and created text file)

in gitbash- git add (filename with extension) 

check status (shows recent updates in files)- git status

commit and push to github.com

git commit -m "(comment text goes here)" (filename.txt)

git push -u origin master



deleting a file:

git rm file1.txt
git commit -m "remove file1.txt"

But if you want to remove the file only from the Git repository and not remove it from the filesystem, use:

git rm --cached file1.txt
git commit -m "remove file1.txt"

And to push changes to remote repo

git push origin branch_name
